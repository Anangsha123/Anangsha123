## Apple Vision Pro: Know About the Design

To get virtual reality experience through Apple Vision Pro, Apple shuts those cameras and make  it seem like one is completely isolated from what’s going on around the world, allowing one to  
focus solely on what is displayed on the headset screens. This shift between the real and immersive is controlled by on-device digital crown.  **_Apple Vision Pro is not unlike a pair of ski goggles_**, featuring a singular piece of laminated glass for the front that melds into an aluminum alloy frame. A soft, fitted Light Seal attaches  magnetically to the frame and conforms to the face to block out light.

Two Audio Straps with built-in speakers are positioned at the sides of the headset which delivers Spatial Audio that blends what one is hearing on the headset with what is going on in the real world. The Audio Straps connect to a 3D knitted headband that holds the Apple Vision Pro in place. The device is designed to be breathable, cushiony, and stretchy for comfort. The Fit Dial ensures the headset fits tight against the head. Apple plans to offer Light Seals and headbands in multiple sizes, and these components are swappable. Inside the frame, there are two **micro-OLED** displays that deliver over 4K resolution to each eye for a total of 23 million pixels. There's also an external display called EyeSight that projects an image of the eyes so people can tell whether they are using the headset in an immersive mode or if they can see what's going on around you. For glasses wearers, there are custom prescription Zeiss Optical Inserts that can be attached magnetically to the headset's lenses.  

There are no controllers for Apple Vision Pro, with the headset instead controlled by eye  tracking, hand gestures, and voice commands. An app can be navigated to and highlighted by looking at it and then opened with a tap of the fingers. Scrolling can be done with a simple flick of the fingers.

With more than dozen cameras and sensors in Apple Vision Pro, the device map out the world around individual by keeping track of their hands and eyes movements. **_Optic ID, which scans the iris with infrared lights and cameras, is used for authentication._** There are two Apple silicon chips inside Apple Vision Pro. The M2 chip runs visionOS, executes computer vision algorithms, and provides graphics, while the R1 chip processes input from the cameras, sensors, and microphones.

Apple Vision Pro does not have a battery instead it can be charged by a braided cable that is attached to a battery pack worn at the hip or plugged into an adapter. The battery pack offers two hours of battery life on a single charge.
